* Use Any Font uses Font Conversion API developed by Dnesscarkey. Font conversion API helps the plugin to convert the font files in different format (woff, woff2 but not limited to) for faster loading, and multiple browser support. Plugins sends the request to Font conversion server with font files, font conversion server converts it and returns the converted files. Once the conversion is completed, font files are automatically deleted.
* We don't store your fonts in our server neither any of your information except the API key details. Our server deletes the temporary file after the font upload is complete. Your font files are served from your own server.
* For font conversion, our plugin uses server2.dnesscarkey.org and server3.dnesscarkey.org and it is only dedicated to Use Any Font plugin.
* For Font Conversion API terms and condition. Please visit <a href="https://dineshkarki.com.np/use-any-font/terms-conditions">here</a>.
